# AI-Driven-Medical-Insurance-Premium-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts medical insurance premiums based on personal health and lifestyle data. Traditional insurance premium calculations are often manual, time-consuming, and inconsistent. By leveraging AI, we can create a more accurate, efficient, and transparent pricing system.
