#AI-Driven-Medical-Insurance-Premium-Prediction

##Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts medical insurance premiums based on personal health and lifestyle data. Traditional insurance premium calculations are often manual, time-consuming, and inconsistent. By leveraging AI, we can create a more accurate, efficient, and transparent pricing system.

##Problem Statement
Current medical insurance premium calculation methods have several issues:
Manual processes lead to errors and inefficiency.
Inconsistent pricing due to lack of personalization.
Poor risk assessment, leading to inaccurate predictions.
Lack of real-time prediction capabilities.
This project aims to solve these issues using AI-driven techniques.
