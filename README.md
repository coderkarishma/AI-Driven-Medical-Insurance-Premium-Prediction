# AI-Driven-Medical-Insurance-Premium-Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts medical insurance premiums based on personal health and lifestyle data. Traditional insurance premium calculations are often manual, time-consuming, and inconsistent. By leveraging AI, we can create a more accurate, efficient, and transparent pricing system.

## Problem Statement
Current medical insurance premium calculation methods have several issues:
- Manual processes lead to errors and inefficiency.
- Inconsistent pricing due to lack of personalization.
- Poor risk assessment, leading to inaccurate predictions.
- Lack of real-time prediction capabilities.
This project aims to solve these issues using AI-driven techniques.

## Objectives
-**Accurate Pricing:** Predict fair premiums based on health and lifestyle data.
-**Improved Efficiency:** Automate calculations to save time and reduce errors.
-**Fair and Transparent Pricing:** Use real data for fair cost estimation.
-**Better Risk Assessment:** Help insurers make better decisions.
-**Real-Time Predictions:** Quickly process large volumes of data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Prepare and preprocess data for accuracy.
2. **Model Training:** Implement machine learning models for prediction.
3. **Integration:** Connect the trained model with a user interface.
4. **Optimization:** Enhance the model for better performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyCaret, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Dataset:** Kaggle dataset
- **Interface:** Streamlit for user-friendly interaction

## Implementation Steps
- Data preprocessing and analysis.
- Regression modeling using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting.
- Model evaluation and accuracy testing.
- User interface development using Streamlit.

## Hardware & Software Requirements
- **Hardware:** Minimum 4GB RAM, Pentium IV processor or higher, 2GB HDD
- **Software:** Python, Kaggle dataset, PyCaret
